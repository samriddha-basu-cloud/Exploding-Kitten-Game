Welcome to the Exploding Kittens card game! This is an online single-player card game where you try to draw cards from a deck without exploding kittens blowing up in your face. Let's dive into how the game works and how you can access it locally.

## How the Game Works

### Rules:
- **Types of Cards:**
  - üòº **Cat Card**: Harmless card, just a cute cat.
  - üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Defuse Card**: Used to defuse an exploding kitten.
  - üîÄ **Shuffle Card**: Shuffles the deck and resets the game.
  - üí£ **Exploding Kitten Card**: Instant game over if drawn.

- **Gameplay:**
  - Clicking on the deck reveals a card.
  - If it's a cat card, it's removed from the deck.
  - If it's an exploding kitten card and you don't have a defuse card, you lose.
  - If it's a defuse card, it's removed from the deck and can be used to defuse an exploding kitten later.
  - If it's a shuffle card, the game restarts with a freshly shuffled deck.
  - Win the game by drawing all non-exploding kitten cards.

### For Node.js (React Frontend):
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the frontend server: `npm start`
3. Access the game at: `http://localhost:3000`

### For Go Lang (Backend):
1. Install dependencies: `go mod tidy`
2. Build the Go server: `go build -o main`
3. Start the server: `./main`

Sure, here are the steps to set up Redis for your project along with some example code snippets:

### For Redis DB(Backend):

#### Step 1: Install Redis

First, you need to install Redis on your system. You can download and install Redis from the official website or use package managers like `apt` or `brew` depending on your operating system.

#### Step 2: Start Redis Server

Start the Redis server on your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
redis-server
redis-server-start
```

This command will start the Redis server with default configurations.


#### Step 3: Close Redis Connection

Don't forget to close the Redis connection when you're done:

```bash
redis-server-stop
```
That's it! You've successfully set up Redis for your project and connected to it using Go Lang. Now you can use Redis to store and retrieve data as needed.
